Hello, hello, hello. This is the Vanilla JavaScript podcast. I'm Chris Ferdinandi. Thanks so much for joining me.

So lately, I have been seeing the Twitter web dev grifters all posting the same format of tweet.

> HTML and CSS => GitHub and Git => Tailwind and CSS => JavaScript => React/Vue => TypeScript => Node.js => MongoDB
>
> Congrats, you're a front-end developer

Wow, is that some gatekeeping nonsense. Here's a more accurate version.

> Enough HTML to cobble together a static webpage?
>
> Congrats, you're a front-end developer.

That's it, that's the benchmark, HTML.

CSS is great and it's incredibly powerful. JavaScript can add all sorts of interactivity and app-like functionality.

Tooling on top of those can make what you build easier or harder and worse for users, depending on what the tools are and how you set them up.

All that you need to be a front-end developer is HTML. That's the foundation, that's it. That's the whole thing. Anything else is just icing on top.

So hey, my pocket guides are short-focused JavaScript courses and e-books made for beginners. In each one, you'll learn the ins and outs of a specific topic in about an hour.

If that sounds interesting to you, head over to vanillajsguides.com to learn more and use the code `yayitsmay` at checkout to get 50% off every single guide or bundle at sale ends this weekend. So that's Sunday, May 14th. So don't miss out.

That's it for today, see you next time. Cheers.
